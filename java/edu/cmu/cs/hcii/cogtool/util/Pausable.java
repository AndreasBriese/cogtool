//      Cancelables/Stoppables/Pausables is a mess. We shouldn't be using
//      the type hierarchy to fiddle this stuff. Instead we should have a
//      single interface for control of a background operation, subsuming
//      all of Cancelable, Stoppable and Pausable, and a single ProgressBar
//      type that takes a bunch of flags indicating what buttons it should
//      display.
